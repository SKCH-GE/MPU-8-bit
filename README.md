# MPU-8-bit

A simple 8-bit Microprocessing Unit (MPU) implementation in Logisim, designed to demonstrate fundamental CPU architecture and operations.

## Overview

This project implements a basic 8-bit MPU with essential components including:
- Control Unit
- Flag handling
- Register operations
- Basic arithmetic capabilities

## Features

The MPU supports three fundamental operations:
1. Load A - Loads a value into Register A
2. Load B - Loads a value into Register B
3. ADD and Store - Performs addition of registers A and B, storing the result in RAM

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Logisim installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `.circ` file using Logisim

### Troubleshooting

If the circuit doesn't work immediately:
1. Locate the "RAM content" file in the project directory
2. Insert its contents into the RAM component in the circuit

## Technical Details

The MPU demonstrates core computing principles including:
- Basic CPU architecture
- Control unit implementation
- Flag handling and status management
- Memory operations
- Register-based computing

## Educational Value

This project serves as a practical demonstration of:
- Fundamental CPU design principles
- Digital logic implementation
- Computer architecture basics
- Memory and register operations

## Project Status

This is an educational project designed to illustrate basic MPU concepts. Feel free to use it for learning purposes or extend its functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the design or documentation are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for discussion.
